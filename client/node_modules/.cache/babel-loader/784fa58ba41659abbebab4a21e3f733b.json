This was a very difficult assignment for me. I had to break down my understanding of javascript and reorganize it. I developed a love for console logging to see where my code is heading. I reached out to TAs, instructors in office hours, and many other students in an effort to find my way here. I spent 10 hours today studying to figure this out. What I've provided is a code that will accept user's input password criteria. It works if only some of the criteria is entered. It works if no criteria is entered, prompting the user to try again, and it works in denying usage of a number of characters not allowed. The code loops so that if the user fails to correctly input choices, it will run again. The code takes randomized characters from arrays and builds a password with them. Once the randomized password is created, the code prints that on the user's viewport. Although difficult, I had fun with this project, and enjoyed the mental breakthroughs of clarity that came along with it. Be sure to go through the viewport and click cancel on all the confirmations, thats my favorite. 03 JavaScript: Password Generator Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some examples.

One of the options didnt scroll down when clicked like it was supposed to, that works now. I added this by recognizing it from another piece of code: line 32: I added multiple photo alt attributes for accessibility standards I added multiple icon alt attributes for accessibility standards lines 34; 42; 50; 61; 69; 77 alt=\"photo of cluttered desk alt=\"photo of laptop in use alt=\"photo of team collaboration\" alt=\"sales funnel icon\" alt=\"lightbulb with wifi icon\" alt=\"money signs icon\" Changes I made to the CSS file Here I labeled sections which have similar info, so that it is easy to find info related to certain html sections I consolidated some lines of code into a single line Here is what I did in the CSS Noted purpose of lines number 11 through 189 removed 3 lines of code i felt i didnt' need on line 35</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm\">\n            \n               \n                <h3> <a href=\"https://jaguilar1029531.github.io/HomeworkNumber2/homework2/\">Portfolio</a> </h3>\n                <h3> <a href=\"https://github.com/jaguilar1029531/homework/tree/master/02-Homework\">Github Code</a> </h3>\n                <p>THREE PAGE HTML HOMEWORK WORK DONE BY GEORGE AGUILAR\n\n                  THE GOAL OF THIS HOMEWORK WAS TO UTILIZE BOOTSTRAP AND TO MINIMIZE LOCAL CSS AND MEDIA QUERIES\n                  \n                  I FEEL LIKE I OVERCAME A LOT OF OBSTACLES AND MADE SOME GOOD BREAKTHROUGHS.\n                  \n                  CHANGES I MADE TO INDEX.HTML\n                  THE FIRST THING I DID WAS APPLY A LINK TO THE BOOTSTRAP WHERE I CAN GRAB ALL MY STYLES FROM\n                  \n                  I CHOSE A NAV BAR THAT LOOKED GOOD FROM BOOTSTRAP.

This was a very difficult assignment for me. I had to break down my understanding of javascript and reorganize it. I developed a love for console logging to see where my code is heading. I reached out to TAs, instructors in office hours, and many other students in an effort to find my way here. I spent 10 hours today studying to figure this out. What I've provided is a code that will accept user's input password criteria. It works if only some of the criteria is entered. It works if no criteria is entered, prompting the user to try again, and it works in denying usage of a number of characters not allowed. The code loops so that if the user fails to correctly input choices, it will run again. The code takes randomized characters from arrays and builds a password with them. Once the randomized password is created, the code prints that on the user's viewport. Although difficult, I had fun with this project, and enjoyed the mental breakthroughs of clarity that came along with it. Be sure to go through the viewport and click cancel on all the confirmations, thats my favorite.\n\n                  03 JavaScript: Password Generator\n                  Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.\n                  \n                  If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some examples.\n                  \n                  User Story\n                  AS AN employee with access to sensitive data\n                  I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria\n                  SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security\n                  Acceptance Criteria\n                  GIVEN I need a new, secure password\n                  WHEN I click the button to generate a password\n                  THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria\n                  WHEN prompted for password criteria\n                  THEN I select which criteria to include in the password\n                  WHEN prompted for the length of the password\n                  THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters\n                  WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password\n                  THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters\n                  WHEN I answer each prompt\n                  THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected\n                  WHEN all prompts are answered\n                  THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria\n                  WHEN the password is generated\n                  THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page</p>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm\">\n            \n                <h3> <a href=\"https://jaguilar1029531.github.io/newTimedQuizHW/\">Timed Quiz</a> </h3>\n                <h3> <a href=\"https://github.com/jaguilar1029531/newTimedQuizHW\">Github Code</a> </h3>\n                <p>newTimedQuizHW\n                  I messed up and deleted my last repository because it got too entangled with mistakes, but I have a screenshot that shows I made 13 commits before creating this one\n                  \n                  i've never had to do so much google-fu in my life, and yes this is not complete but i wanted to turn in something.
